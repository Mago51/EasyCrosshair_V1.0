# EasyCrosshair_V1.0
I made this Crosshair tool, because I didn't want to pay 5$ on the steam market for Crosshair X. The purpose of the tool is to project a simple cross, circle or a + in the midde of the screen. It will be displayed as the most top Layer. Usefull for Games you get a little advantage.
